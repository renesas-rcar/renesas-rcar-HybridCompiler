ParameterName,Data Type,Default Value,Descriptions
CalibNumBins,int,2048,"constant to specify the number of bins for the calibration methods that create histograms. For Entropy calibration, basically we will only use the default value 2048"
CalibDatasetStride,int,None,"constant to devide dataset to save the memory usage. If None, this is ignored."
CalibSaveHistogram,str,None,"path to save the histogram data. If None, this is ignored."
CalibLoadHistogram,str,None,"path to load the histogram data. If None, this is ignored."
SearchWindowThreshold,float,99.99999,"constant to determine the lower limit of search window width."
FineGrainedSearchStep,int,4,"step for the second stage of search, the fine-grained search, of entropy calibration."
LongTailDistributionCountermeasure,str,None,"whether to use special measurement for searching the optimal range of long-tail distribution. Now 'MinMax' is the only acceptable value. If None, this is ignored"
