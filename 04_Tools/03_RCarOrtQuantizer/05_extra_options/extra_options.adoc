== Extra options

The available extra_options are sourced from two parts: the original options in onnxruntime v1.17.1 and newly-added options for rcar_ort_quantizer. For details about the original options in onnxruntime, see details link:https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/v1.17.1/onnxruntime/python/tools/quantization/quantize.py#L343[here]. We will only list the newly-added options for rcar_ort_quantizer in this documentation.
