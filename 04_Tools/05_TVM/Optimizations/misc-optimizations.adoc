= Miscellaneous Optimizations

Some of the other notable optimizations are described here.

== Operator fusion for MatMul+Add

The frontend replaces a MatMul+Add combination with a call to an optimized implementation of MatMulAdd DKL fused operator when the result of the intermediate MatMul operator isn't used by anything else.

== Skip unnecessary slice 

The frontend removes slice operators that have a stride of 1 and whose begin and end parameters cover the entire axis.
