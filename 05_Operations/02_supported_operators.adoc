= Table of supported operators

The Hybrid Compiler (hereafter HyCo) supports ONNX operators (up to `Opset 17`), and Pytorch operators in the table below.

Latest information:

* ONNX operators can be found https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Operators.md[here].
* pytorch operators can be found https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html[here] or https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html[here].

"*fp32*" is float type, "*○*" is supported, and "*x*" is not supported. Also, whether it is "*int8*" or "*bool*" depends on the operator specification.
`Operator` is a link to the individual operator description. In addition, the "*Operator*" in the Table is based on ONNX. Please refer to the sections for each operator for the related pytorch operator.
