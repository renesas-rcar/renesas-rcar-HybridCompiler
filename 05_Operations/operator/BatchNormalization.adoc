|*Attribute* |*DataType* |*Support* |*Note*

|epsilon |float |Greater than 0. |The epsilon value to use to avoid division by zero.
|momentum |float |[0, 1] |Factor used in computing the running mean and variance.e.g., running_mean = running_mean * momentum + mean * (1 - momentum).
|===

==== Restriction and Limitation

* CNNIP
** CNNIP does not support the `BatchNormalization` operator.

* DSP
** Supported input tensor dimension: [2, 7]
** Supported output tensor dimension: [2, 7]
** If inputs or outputs are non-dense, then fallback to the reference implementation.
** The input tensor shape and the output tensor shape must be the same.
** Simplify Inference converts to `Mul+Add` for `TVM`.
** FP32 operator only verified with stand-alone test case.
** In torch.nn.functional.batch_norm, int8 is not yet supported.
