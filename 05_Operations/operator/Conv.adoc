==== Restriction and Limitation

* CNNIP
** Supported input tensor dimension: 4.
** Supported with following limitations.
*** H/W limitations.
**** `kernel size`: 1 to 5.
**** `stride`: 1 to 3.
**** `padding`: 0 to 16 (x-direction), 0 to 7 (y-direction)
**** `dilation`: 1 to 4. (x-direction only)
*** Normal Convolution supported with following limitations.
**** Only support `conv kernel` 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, 1x3, 3x1, 1x5, 5x1.
*** Conv `stride` 1 to 3, for `conv kernel` 1x1 is supported.
*** `Depthwise` Convolution is supported. Supported with following limitations.
**** `kernel size`: 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, 1x3, 3x1, 1x5, 5x1.
**** `stride`: 1 to 3.
**** `padding`: 0 to 2.
*** `Dilation` is not supported yet.
*** `Group convolution` is supported.
*** `Asymmetric conv stride` is supported.
*** `Large convolution kernel (by 10x10)` is not supported yet.
*** 8bit supported.

* DSP
** Supported input tensor dimension: [0, 7]
** Supported output tensor dimension: [0, 7]
** If inputs or outputs are non-dense, then fallback to the reference implementation.
** Only `conv1d, conv2d, conv3d` are supported. Bias (an optional input in ONNX) is mandatory by DKL.
** Limited to `stride <= 4`, `padding <= 7`, `dilation = 1` for `TVM`.
** The weight tensor must be per-channel quantized.
** This function has several cases where faster implementations are used if specific conditions are met. Those cases are as follows:
*** Depthwise Convolution with large dilations
**** The number of groups must be equal to the number of input and output channels (Depthwise Convolution).
**** All `strides` must be 1.
**** All `kernel size` must be 3.
**** All `padding` must be equal to the dilations of the corresponding dimension.
**** All `dilation` must be less than the input shapes of the corresponding dimension.
**** The sum of the following values must fit into the size of the working memory in bytes, where ceil64 is a function that rounds up to the nearest multiple of 64:
***** 4 * ceil64((2 * dilation_h + 1) * in_width)
***** 10 * ceil64(out_width)
***** 640
*** Convolution with large dilations
**** The number of groups must be 1 (standard convolution).
**** All strides must be 1.
**** All kernel sizes must be 3.
**** All padding must be equal to the dilations of the corresponding dimension.
**** All dilations must be less than the input shapes of the corresponding dimension.
**** The sum of the following values must fit into the size of the working memory in bytes, where ceil64 is a function that rounds up to the nearest multiple of 64:
***** 4 * ceil64((2 * dilation_h + 1) * in_width)
***** 9 * ceil64(out_width)
***** 1024
*** Convolution with large strides
**** The number of groups must be 1 (standard convolution).
**** All dilations must be 1.
**** All kernel sizes must be 8.
**** All strides must be equal to the kernel sizes of the corresponding dimension.
**** There must be no padding.
**** The sum of the following values must fit into the size of the working memory in bytes, where ceil64 is a function that rounds up to the nearest multiple of 64:
***** 12 * ceil64(8 * out_width)
***** ceil64(out_width)
***** 1536
** FP32 operator only verified with stand-alone test case.
