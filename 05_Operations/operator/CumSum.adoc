|*Attribute* |*DataType* |*Support* |*Note*

|exclusive |uint8 |0, 1 |If set to 1, the j-th output element would be the sum of the first (j-1) elements. Otherwise, it would be the sum of the first j elements.
|reverse |uint8 |0, 1 |If set to 1 will perform the sums in reverse direction.

==== Restriction and Limitation

* CNNIP
** CNNIP does not support the `CumSum` operator.

* DSP
** Supported input tensor dimension: [0, 7]
** Supported output tensor dimension: [0, 7]
** If inputs or outputs are non-dense, then fallback to the reference implementation.
** The input and output tensor shape must not be equal to 0.
** Accepted range of `axis` is [0, r-1] where r = rank(data).
** In `torch.cumsum` has an argument `dtype`, which must be set to `None` (None is default).
