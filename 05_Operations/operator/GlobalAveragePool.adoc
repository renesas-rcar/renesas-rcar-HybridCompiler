==== Attribute

None.

==== Restriction and Limitation

* CNNIP
** Supported input tensor dimension: 4.
** Limited to feature maps that fit in SMPC with shape <= (4096, 128) for `TVM`. +
(SMPC: Scratch pad memory in R-Car)
** Width and height are less than [126, 126]
** Supported 8bit input -> 8bit output.
** Bit width of summed value: 32bit (x32ch)

* DSP
** Supported input tensor dimension: [3, 5]
** Supported output tensor dimension: [3, 5]
** If inputs or outputs are non-dense, then fallback to the reference implementation.
** Make sure that the sum of `pooling_size` must be smaller than `0x800000`.
** Only kernel dimensions 1, 2, and 3 are supported.
** Regarding torch operator, `torch.nn.functional.adaptive_avg_pool2d` is supported.
*** The input tensor dimension is only 4.
