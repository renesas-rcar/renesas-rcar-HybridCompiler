==== Restriction and Limitation

* CNNIP
** CNNIP does not support the `GridSample` operator.

* DSP
** Supported input tensor dimension: `int8` is 4 and 5, `FP32` is 4 only.
** Supported output tensor dimension: `int8` is 4 and 5, `FP32` is 4 only.
** The batch size of `grid` equal to `input`.
** The last shape element of `grid` must be 2.
** The `input`, `grid`, `output` must be dense.
** The `output_scale` must be not equal to 0.f.
** If the following condition(s) are not satisfied, then fallback to the reference implementation:
*** The `align_corners` must be equal to 0.
*** The `interpolation_mode` must be equal to `BILINEAR`.
*** The `padding_mode` must be equal to `ZERO`.
*** The `input`, `grid`, `output` must be dense.
*** The `grid_h_max` must be greater than or equal to 1.
** FP32 operator only verified with stand-alone test case.
** In `torch..nn.functional.grid_sample`, FP32 is not yet supported.
