|*Attribute* |*DataType* |*Support* |*Note*

|keepdims |uint32 |0, 1 a| 0 means reduce all axes. +
1 means keep reduced dimension.
|noop_with_empty_axes |uint32 |0, 1 a| Defines behavior if 'axes' is empty. +
1 means input tensor will not be reduced, and the output tensor would be equivalent to input tensor.
|===

==== Restriction and Limitation

* CNNIP
** CNNIP does not support the `ReduceLogSum` operator.

* DSP
** Supported input tensor dimension: [0, 7].
** Supported output tensor dimension: [0, 7].
** If inputs or outputs are non-dense, then fallback to the reference implementation.
** The input / output shape must be not equal 0.
