HyCo supports https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Operators.md#Squeeze[onnx opset 13], https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.squeeze.html[torch.squeeze].

==== Attribute

None.

==== Restriction and Limitation

* CNNIP
** CNNIP does not support the `Squeeze` operator.

* DSP
** Supported input tensor dimension: [0, 7]
** Supported output tensor dimension: [0, 7]
** If inputs or outputs are non-dense, then fallback to the reference implementation.
** Not supported for cases where the input and output scale and zero-point match and the squeeze output tensor is less than 1-dimensional for `TVM`.
** FP32 operator only verified with stand-alone test case. This operator will be removed by `TVM` inference for latency improvement, because this is a memory operator.
