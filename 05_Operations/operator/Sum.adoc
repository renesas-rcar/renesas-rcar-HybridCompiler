HyCo supports https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Operators.md#Sum[onnx opset 13], https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.sum.html[torch.sum].

==== Attribute

None.

==== Restriction and Limitation

* CNNIP
** CNNIP does not support the `Sum` operator.

* DSP
** Supported input tensor dimension: [0, 7]
** Supported output tensor dimension: [0, 7]
** If inputs or outputs are non-dense, then fallback to the reference implementation.
** `DKL` can only support up to 10 inputs per kernel. `TVM` can support more than 10 inputs by decomposing it to several `DKL` kernels.
** FP32 operator only verified with stand-alone test case.
